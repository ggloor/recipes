Basic recipe from Jason Gloor, adapted by Greg Gloor with help from Tartine Bread

One of the best presents I've received is when Jason taught me how to make bread. My grandmother used to make bread and I recall the wonderful aroma that filled the mobile home she lived in on the farm.

This is excellent bread and is very easy if you have an active starter.
