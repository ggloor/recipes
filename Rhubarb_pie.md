# rhubarb meringue pie

rhubarb meringue pie is a spring favourite. For years I tried to make it like Nana did. She would always remark on how runny my pie was.

then she told me the secret, "every damn fool knows to put tapioca in rhubarb pie"

typical nana! I'm saving you years of humiliation by sharing the secret here.

### Edna and Nana

## Ingredients for two pies

- 5-6 thick stalks (about 5-6 cups cut up into 1/2 -3/4 inch chunks)

- 6 eggs separated

- 6 Tbs flour

- 6 Tbs water

- 6 Tbs melted butter

- 2 cups sugar 

- cinnamon 

- 2 deep dish pie shells (home made or bought; I don't like the crust anyway)

- 1 or 2 Tbs Tapioca

## Instructions

- pour several cups of boiling water over the cut up rhubarb. Let is sit while you do the rest. I like to use the rhubarb water for the next step.

- make a custard as follows: whisk the flour, sugar and water together. Add in the melted butter, whisk again. Add in the egg yolks and half the tapioca. Mix until smooth

- drain the rhubarb

- put the other half of the tapioca in the bottom of the pie shell, and half the rhubarb in each pie shell, add in the mixed custard

- bake at 425 for 15 minutes, then 325 for half an hour. It should be set

- let the pie cool. I cook the pies in the morning, and put the meringue on just before serving

- make a meringue by beating the egg whites with 6 Tbs of white sugar and 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar. Make it stiff!

- spread the meringue on the pie, and bake at 325 for 12 minutes. you can also broil - but watch so it doesn't burn
