# Barbecue sauce for ribs or chicken

## by Chantal Gloor

A family favourite!

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp vegetable oil

- 1 large onion chopped fine

- just a little less than 1/3 cup brown sugar

- 3/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup spicy barbecue sauce (can use more of one and less of other .... if no bbq sauce, add extra hot sauce and spices)

- 1/4 cup lemon juice

- 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce

- 1 tsp Dijon mustard

- 1 tsp chili powder

- pinch of cayenne pepper

- dash of Louisiana hot sauce or Tabasco

## Making Sauce (Can Make In Advance)

Heat the oil on low and cook the onion until softened but not browned. Stir in the brown sugar and cook over low heat with constant stirring until the sugar has disolved.

Remove from heat and stir in the rest of the ingredients.

## Cooking the Ribs

In a roasting pan put in 1.5-2 kg of ribs. Pour over about 2 cups of boiling water. Cover (we use tinfoil) and cook in the oven at 350 degrees for at least 1 1/2 hours. A little longer won't hurt

Pour off most of the water, then put the BBQ sauce on top.

Cook covered for 15 minutes, then uncovered for 15 minutes, then broil for 5 minutes.
