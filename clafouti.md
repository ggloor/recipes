# Gluten Free Clafouti

## Basic recipe from the Globe and Mail November 2017, adapted by Chantal Gloor

Chantal always made great fruit deserts, but the addition to our family of a gluten intolerant in-law necessitated changing to gluten free deserts.

This has been made with just about every sour fruit you can imagine; cherries, peaches, raspberries or blueberries (to name a few). It is always a highlight after dinner.

## The flour

Every type of gluten-free flour will behave differently. Chantal has tried a number of different types and prefers ?, ? or ?.

## The Mix

Whisk together:

- 1 cup whipping cream

- 1/2 cup sugar

- 3 large eggs (we prefer them fresh from the farm, but others are OK)

- 1 tbsp brandy extract (vanilla extract also works)

Add in the:

- 1/2 cup gluten free flour

- 1/2 tsp baking powder

- 1/2 tsp salt

and mix.

## baking

Preheat oven to $375^o$F. Coat a 10 inch glass pan with oil (Chantal uses spray cooking oil) and dust with the gluten free flour.

Place in the pan:

- 3 cups of chopped fruit (if using peaches for example) or berries

- 1 cup chopped almonds or pecans

Pour the mix onto the fruit and nuts. Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes until puffy.

Cool, serve from the pan, and bask in the compliments!
