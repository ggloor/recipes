# Sourdough Bread

## Basic recipe from Jason Gloor, adapted by Greg Gloor with help from Tartine Bread

One of the best presents I've received is when Jason taught me how to make bread. My grandmother used to make bread and I recall the wonderful aroma that filled the mobile home she lived in on the farm.

There are a few keys to making good sourdough.

- good flour

- an active starter culture

- a long rise and proof

## The flour

Every type of flour will behave differently. I have tried Robin Hood flour bread flour available at any grocery store, and artisanal flour from the Arva Flour Mill. I prefer the Arva Flour Mill flour.

## Maintaining the starter

Maintaining a starter is nearly idiot proof, but there are times when some resuscitation is required. I keep my starter in a plastic container. I find Farm Boy soup containers to be ideal. I have kept the same starter alive for over two years by following this simple protocol.

1) Day 1 (Wed am). take starter from fridge and remove almost all the starter from the container. Add 1-2 TB of white flour, and an equal amount of whole wheat flour. Add a little less than an equal amount of cool tap water (2-3 TB). Mix, and leave at room temperature. this is the feeding step.

2) Day 2 (Thur am). Remove almost all the starter from the container and repeat the feeding.

3) Day 3 (Thurs pm). Remove almost all the starter from the container and repeat the feeding.

4) Day 4 (Fri am). Remove almost all the starter from the container and add 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup white flour, and 1 cup of tap water.

5) Day 4 (Fri pm). At the end of the day, usually 5:30 or 6, I make bread with the starter. The remainder I store by adding 2 TB white flour, 2 TB whole wheat flour, and about 2 TB water. Mix,well and store in the fridge. Keeps for up to 2 weeks.

#### Note: if the starter is very active, the maintenance and feeding can be done starting on Thurs or even Fri AM. This appears to be seasonal and a little unpredictable.

## The Bread recipe

I use the Tartine Bread Recipe modified as follows:

Add the starter mix from Day 4 that has sat for 6-8 hours (It should be nice and fluffy) to 2 1/2 cups of tap water, and 1/4 tsp or less of dry yeast (not bread yeast). Mix well (I use a mixer).

1 slightly heaping cup of whole wheat flour and 6 slightly above level cups of hard white flour to the above (I use Arva Flour Mills flour). You will have to experiment with the actual amounts of flour and water a bit. I notice that less water is needed in the summer (when it is humid) than in the middle of winter (when the air is dry) Work into a mass. At the end it should be a well formed ball. Work those forearms. Again I use a mixer with a dough-hook.

Let sit 30 min - 1 hour covered

Add 1 1/2 Tb salt and about 2 Tbsp hot water, a little at a time as you work the dough with wet hands. The Tartine book is a great resource for how to do this. I take one side of the mass and fold it over the top of the mass, stretch it as much as you can. I do this 4 times, rotating 90 degrees each time

let sit 30 min, and mix with wet hands every 30 min thereafter until it is a nicely cohesive mass. The last 2 -3 mixes I do as long pulls that I wrap around my hand, repeating with a 90 degree turn. When it is tough to mix it is done (Usually 3-5 mixes)

let sit about an hour or so, covered. it should be somewhat inflated

cut in half, and form each mass into a nice ball by rotating as a ball on the counter by squeezing your hands together as you turn. Do not use flour!. The goal here is to get a ball that when rotated turns back a little. There is lots of tension on the gluten in the flourr

let sit half an hour, covered

put into wicker proofing pans and place covered in the fridge (6-8 degrees C) for 8-12 hours. If your fridge is cold let it sit longer, or take it out for a while until you cook it. covered. you can also use a casserole dish or bread pan that has been oiled to proof the bread.

Transfer to a flour-covered pizza stone, or to a flour-covered pyrex bread pan. Score the top with a sharp knife about 1/3 of the way deep.

Bake at 450 degrees (covered by a bigger pan) for 20 min, and 450 degrees uncovered on a flour-covered pizza stone.  Alternatively, if you don't have a pan to cover, you can put a roasting tray in the oven and add 1 to 1.5 cups of water at the same time as you put the  bread in. this creates steam for the first 15-20 minutes of cooking.

you will need to experiment with the timing a bit for your oven and your pans. I use a rectangular pizza stone, cover the bread with a metal pan for the first 20, and uncover for the second 20. Tartine suggests a dutch oven. In this case you might try 15 and 15 since metal is a better conductor than the pizza ceramic

Let sit for about half an hour. Can be frozen in tinfoil and plastic if needed. To re-thaw bake 450 for 20 min and then let sit for 30.

Keeps for 5-7 days or so (first 2 are great, toast the last three is amazing).
