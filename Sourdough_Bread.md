# Sourdough Bread

## Basic recipe from Jason Gloor, adapted by Greg Gloor with help from Tartine Bread

One of the best presents I've received is when Jason taught me how to make bread. My grandmother used to make bread and I recall the wonderful aroma that filled the mobile home she lived in on the farm.

There are a few keys to making good sourdough.

- good flour

- an active starter culture

- a long rise and proof

## The flour

Every type of flour will behave differently. I have tried Robin Hood flour bread flour available at any grocery store, and artisanal flour

## Maintaining the starter

Maintaining a starter is nearly idiot proof, but there are times when some resuscitation is required. I keep my starter in a plastic container. I find Farm Boy soup containers to be ideal. I have kept the same starter alive for over two years by following this simple protocol.

1) Day 1 (Wed am). take starter from fridge and remove almost all the starter from the container. Add 2-3 TB of white flour, and an equal amount of whole wheat flour. Add a little less than an equal amount of cool tap water (3-5 TB). Mix, and leave at room temperature. this is the feeding step.

2) Day 2 (Thur am). Remove almost all the starter from the container and repeat the feeding.

3) Day 3 (Thurs pm). Remove almost all the starter from the container and repeat the feeding.

4) Day 4 (Fri am). Remove almost all the starter from the container and add 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup white flour, and 7/8 cup of cool water (72 degrees).
