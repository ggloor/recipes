# Sourdough Bread

## Basic recipe from Jason Gloor, adapted by Greg Gloor with help from Tartine Bread

One of the best presents I've received is when Jason taught me how to make bread. My grandmother used to make bread and I recall the wonderful aroma that filled the mobile home she lived in on the farm.

There are a few keys to making good sourdough.

- good flour

- an active starter culture

- a long rise and proof

## The flour

Every type of flour will behave differently. I have tried Robin Hood flour bread flour available at any grocery store, and artisanal flour from the Arva Flour Mill. I prefer the Arva Flour Mill flour.

## Maintaining the starter

Maintaining a starter is nearly idiot proof, but there are times when some resuscitation is required. I keep my starter in a plastic container. I find Farm Boy soup containers to be ideal. I have kept the same starter alive for over two years by following this simple protocol.

1) Day 1 (Wed am). take starter from fridge and remove almost all the starter from the container. Add 2-3 TB of white flour, and an equal amount of whole wheat flour. Add a little less than an equal amount of cool tap water (3-5 TB). Mix, and leave at room temperature. this is the feeding step.

2) Day 2 (Thur am). Remove almost all the starter from the container and repeat the feeding.

3) Day 3 (Thurs pm). Remove almost all the starter from the container and repeat the feeding.

4) Day 4 (Fri am). Remove almost all the starter from the container and add 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup white flour, and 7/8 cup of cool water (72 degrees).

5) Day 4 (Fri pm). At the end of the day, usually 5:30 or 6, I make bread with the starter. The remainder I store by adding 2 TB white flour, 2 TB whole wheat flour, and about 2 TB water. Mix,well and store in the fridge

#### Note: if the starter is very active, the maintenance and feeding can be done starting on Thurs AM. This appears to be seasonal and a little unpredictable.

## The Bread recipe

I use the Tartine Bread Recipe modified as follows:

Add the starter mix from Day 4 that has sat for 8-12 hours (It should be nice and fluffy) to 2 1/2 cups of tap water. Mix well (I use a mixer).

1 slightly heaping cup of whole wheat flour and 6 slightly above level cups of hard white flour to the above. Work into a mass. At the end it should be a well formed ball. Work those forearms. Again I use a mixer with a dough-hook

Let sit 30 min - 45 min covered

Add 1 1/2 Tb salt, a little at a time as you work the dough. The Tartine book is a great resource for how to do this

let sit 30 min, and every 30 min thereafter until it is a nicely cohesive mass. When it is tough to mix it is done (Usually 3-4 mixes)

let sit about an hour or so, covered. it should be somewhat inflated

cut in half, and form each mass into a nice ball by rotating as a ball on the counter.

let sit half an hour, covered

put into wicker proofing pans and place covered in the fridge (6-8 degrees C) for 8-12 hours. covered

Bake at 450 degrees (covered by a bigger pan) for 20 min, and 450 degrees uncovered

you will need to experiment with the timing a bit for your oven and your pans. I use a rectangular pizza stone, cover the bread with a metal pan for the first 20, and uncover for the second 20. Tartine suggests a dutch oven. In this case you might try 15 and 15 since metal is a better conductor than the pizza ceramic

Let sit for about half an hour. Can be frozen in tinfoil and plastic if needed. To re-thaw bake 450 for 20 min and then let sit for 30.

Keeps for 5 days or so (first 2 are great, toast the last three is amazing).
