Family and favourite recipes

Over the years we have found, adapted and developed a lot of recipes that have been passed down from grandparent or parent to child, or that we have learned from our children, their spouses or their family. This is an attempt to collect some of them into a central place that we can share amongst ourselves and everyone else. 

Please feel free to access, adpat and add to this site.
